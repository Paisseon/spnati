# Which one is better tho?
The app is better if you:
- Are very space-conscious
- Want ALL the characters
- Don't care about devtools
- Are not jailbroken
- Don't like terminal

The npm version is better if you:
- Want to use custom characters
- Want to cheat (using devtools)
- Don't mind using terminal
- Prefer modular vs all-in-one
- Want something mostly made by competent devs
